Problem: It was detected that libxls can produce memory leaks.
One example is when you try to read a non xls file, ex. xlsx file.

Problem: functions that calls to "seval" causes memory leaks.
This also happens in SC and has to be solved.

Problem: Some cell equations gets messy after undo/redos.
This fix requires implementation of Calc Chain. This will allow
to fix this problem when UNDOing actions that change cells equations.

Problem: Extended ascii chars not showing correctly.
Compile sc-im against -lncursesw and not -lncurses.
