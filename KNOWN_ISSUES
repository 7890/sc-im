Problem: Edit mode doesn't show cursor with TMUX, nor NetBSD
Cause: Tmux / NetBSD incompatibily with ncurses cursor mode number 2 (very visible mode).
Solution: Replace the number '2' by the number '1' in line 180 of screen.c, and
build SCIM again.

Problem: It was detected that libxls can make memory leaks.
One example is when you try to read a non xls file, ex. xlsx file.
